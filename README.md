 removed birthright citizenship - an executive order on january 2oth, president trumps first day in office, he declared “Among the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States:  (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary”(https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/). 
This is an amendment right which he is taking into his own context even though it has had the same meaning for decades. He has twisted the words of the 14th amendment which states “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” (https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf)
This is taking away basic human rights to justify his power because he is a racist fucker. Psa. He is also a drag queen. And to simplify this the 14th amendment states that anyone who is born in the U.S are automatically declared citizens with all their amendment rights given to them also known as “birth rights” and this was passed for anyone born in the U.S anyone. Yes, even mexicans. But now Trump has twisted these words and has removed this birthright citizenship for anyone who has a mother that was undocumented or illegally in the U.S while giving birth, and if the mother was LEGAL AND HAD HER DOCUMENTS but it was “temporary”. If it was temporary the child’s birthright citizenship is automatically removed.

Banning funding for abortion nationwide
Trump has officially ban all funding towards abortion practically outright banning it. This took place on January 25, 2025. “einstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to fund abortion globally.
Issued a rule preventing Title X taxpayer funding from subsiding the abortion industry, Cut all funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which supports coercive abortion and forced sterilization, Signed legislation overturning the previous administration’s regulation that prohibited states from defunding abortion facilities as part of their family planning programs, Fully enforced the separate payment requirement for abortion coverage in Obamacare exchange plans, Stopped the Federal funding of fetal tissue research, Worked to protect healthcare entities and individuals’ conscience rights, ensuring that no medical professional is forced to participate in an abortion in violation of their beliefs, Issued an executive order reinforcing the requirement that all hospitals in the United States provide medical treatment or an emergency transfer for infants who are in need of emergency medical care—regardless of prematurity or disability, Led a coalition of countries to sign the Geneva Consensus Declaration, declaring that there is no international right to abortion and committing to protecting women’s health, First president in history to attend the March for Life.” (https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-enforces-overwhelmingly-popular-demand-to-stop-taxpayer-funding-of-abortion/)
	He is taking away a chance between life or death, vital healthcare. Although he refuses to realize how vital it truly is. People say “its wrong your killing a child” and half of the time they have no clue what they are on about and have done no research. You are also killing the mother without this vitality. Or maybe a little girl who got raped? Taking away a chance at life for her. Or maybe just a mother who got pregnant but her living conditions are horrible. You really want a child to be born and suffer due to maybe starvation, abuse, or anything else. You rather that, than not being born at all be so fr babes. 

 ICE raids
            Ice standing for U.S immigration and customs enforcement. “President Donald Trump has reportedly ordered US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to carry out raids on undocumented immigrant families in at least 10 major cities starting Sunday.” (https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/12/ice-raids-us-immigrant-families-risk-serious-abuses-0?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4-y8BhC3ARIsAHmjC_F7z40QOblP9EWxH6T6O--TZT5u1ptH9iy3dwTYZvQXygF6fWv-WAQaAk3PEALw_wcB)
These people from these check-ins and deportations are being taken to “detention centers” (sound familiar?) “To fulfill the agency’s critical mission, ERO oversees civil immigration detention in facilities nationwide that house aliens to secure their presence for immigration proceedings or removal from the U.S. ICE detains aliens who are subject to mandatory detention or those that ICE determines are a public safety or flight risk during the custody determination process.” (https://www.ice.gov/detention-facilities) 
	These arrests are getting worse by the day and leaving
everyone included with horrible feelings. “We will see more families 
locked up in detention centers, sufferingtrauma, suicidal feelings,
 dangerously inadequate medical care, and sexual assault. 
We will see more family separations, causing increased 
numbers of families to experience severe and lasting harm.”

This is horrible. We are deporting people who have done nothing. Trump just wants to feel good that he has power and thinks he can do anything (which he can basically). And it sucks. Also if you think your safe, your not. he states that “Many of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.  Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities.  Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.” (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/) 
In an overview basically saying that all immigrants are horrible and do dangerous shit. And declaring to deport all undocumented or illegal aliens (“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it arrested 956 people on Sunday. But an NBC News report found immigration authorities had close to 1,200 arrests that day and just 613, or nearly 52%, were considered “criminal arrests. The rest appeared to be nonviolent offenders or people who have not committed any criminal offense other than crossing the border illegally. Being undocumented is considered a civil offense, not a crime.https://www.nbcnews.com/
news/us-news/are-cities-ice-raids-are-taking-place-rcna189390) but that's not true either. ICE is taking anyone they see that fits the part and not even giving them a chance to prove themselves. DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE ALSO BEING TAKEN AWAY BC THEY ACT THE PART!! Also psa if you live in one of the currently targeted states (Operations began Sunday in Chicago, New York City began Tuesday, and three officials said they were planning for the next operation to take place in Aurora, Colorado, on Thursday. However, two sources familiar with the planning said Wednesday the Aurora operation was called off temporarily due to media leaks. One source said the leaks posed an operational security risk for officers involved.”https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/are-cities-ice-raids-are-taking-place-rcna189390)  and you see ICE make sure to yell even scream “la migra” and go and worn people. If ICE officers ask you anything about anyone or anything, you know nothing. <3
